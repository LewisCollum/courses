#+title: 8th Grade NAEP Reading Exam Scores as a Factor of Family Income, Divorce, and State Educational Expenditure
#+author: Lewis Collum (0621539)
#+date: Updated: \today

\newpage

* Introduction
  We are studying the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP)
  reading exam performance of 8th graders, across the states. The test
  is out of 500 points. NAEP administers tests across subjects at the
  4th, 8th, and 12 grade levels, with randomly selected students. We
  would like to see if the exam performance has nationally increased
  since 1990. We would also like to see if we can find a significant
  relationship between reading performance and average family income,
  divorce rates, or educational expenditure, across the states.
* Methods
  <<sec:methods>>
** Is There an Increase in NAEP Reading Exam Scores Since 1990?
   We use a simple linear regression with the model,
   <<sec:hyp_year>>
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{equation}
     \hat{\texttt{score}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \texttt{year}. \label{eq:1}
   \end{equation}
   Our hypotheses are
   \begin{align*} 
     H_0&: \beta_1 = 0; \\
     H_A&: \beta_1 \ne 0.
   \end{align*}
   #+end_export

** Does State Educational Expenditure have a Significant Affect on Scores?
   <<sec:hyp_exp>>
   We use a simple linear regression with the model,
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{equation}
     \hat{\texttt{score}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \texttt{expenditure}
   \end{equation}
   Our hypotheses are
   \begin{align*} 
     H_0&: \beta_1 = 0; \\
     H_A&: \beta_1 \ne 0.
   \end{align*}
   #+end_export

** Does State Divorce Rate have a Significant Affect on Scores?
   <<sec:hyp_div>>
   We use a simple linear regression with the model,
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{equation}
     \hat{\texttt{score}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \texttt{divorce\_rate}
   \end{equation}
   Our hypotheses are
   \begin{align*} 
     H_0&: \beta_1 = 0; \\
     H_A&: \beta_1 \ne 0.
   \end{align*}
   #+end_export

** Does State Median Family Income have a Significant Affect on Scores?
   <<sec:hyp_inc>>
   We use a non-linear regression with the model,
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{equation}
     \hat{\texttt{score}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \texttt{income} + \beta_2 \cdot \texttt{income}^2
   \end{equation}
   Our hypotheses are
   \begin{align*} 
     H_0&: \beta_1 = 0; \\
     H_A&: \beta_1 \ne 0.
   \end{align*}
   #+end_export

* Data
  All hypotheses in section [[sec:methods]] use the =U.S. Education
  Datasets: Unification Project= dataset (section [[sec:data_unif]]) which
  is designed to bring together multiple facets of U.S. education data
  into one dataset. We use the =total expenditure= and =average
  reading score= for eigth grade, from this dataset.

  To find if state median family income has a significant affect on
  reading scores (section [[sec:hyp_inc]]) we use an American Community
  Survey (section [[sec:data_income]]) for median family income by state
  from 2014 to 2018.

  To find if state divorse rate has a significant affect on reading
  scores (section [[sec:hyp_div]]) we use a CDC study (section
  [[sec:data_divorce]]) for divorse rates in 2015.

* Analysis
** Is There an Increase in NAEP Reading Exam Scores Since 1990?
   We compare the NAEP reading scores from 1990 to 2018, to see if
   there is a significant change. We find that 85% of the variance in
   scores is explained by year (i.e. \(R^2\)). We also find that the
   p-value is much less than the significance level of 0.05. As such
   we reject the null hypothesis (eq. \ref{eq:1}) that scores have not
   changed since 1990. We see that scores have increased since 1990
   and the concrete model is
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{equation}
     \hat{\texttt{score}} = -1110 + 0.69 \cdot \texttt{year}. \label{eq:1-an}
   \end{equation}
   #+end_export
   
   The intercept is not interable since we do not have scores for
   students for year 0, since the NAEP study started in 1990. For
   every increase in year of 0.69, the national reading score
   increases by 1 (out of 500 total points).

** Does State Educational Expenditure have a Significant Affect on Scores?
   We compare the NAEP reading scores from 2015 to total educational
   expenditure, per state, to see if there is a significant
   affect. Since each state has a different enrollment count (due to
   population), we divide the total expenditure by the number of
   students enrolled. This gives us the expenditure per student
   approximately. We find that the p-value is 0.49, which is much
   greater than the significance level of 0.05. As such we fail to
   reject the null hypothesis (eq. \ref{eq:2}). We see no significant
   effect from expenditure on scores.

** Does State Divorce Rate have a Significant Affect on Scores?
   We compare the NAEP reading scores from 2015 to divorse rate, per

   of 0.05. In fact, there is almost no relation between the two

   (eq. \ref{eq:3}). We see no significant effect from divorse rate on

*** Non-Linear Model
   We compare the NAEP reading scores from 2015 to median family
   income, per state, to see if there is a significant affect. We find
   that 30% of the variance in scores is explained by year
   (i.e. \(R^2\)). We also find that the p-value is much less than the
   significance level of 0.05. As such we reject the null hypothesis
   (eq. \ref{eq:4}). We see that scores non-linearly increase as
   income increases. With high error towards the higher incomes, this
   model is likely only useful for lower to mid-range incomes. The
   concrete model is
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{equation}
     \hat{\texttt{score}} = 156.1 + 0.0034 \cdot \texttt{income} + -2.58\cdot 10^{-8} \cdot \texttt{income}^2 \label{eq:4-an}
   \end{equation}
   #+end_export
   
   The intercept is not interable since we do not have scores for
   students for year 0, since the NAEP study started in 1990. For
   every increase in year of 0.69, the national reading score
   increases by 1 (out of 500 total points).

   Warnings:
   [1] Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified.
   [2] The condition number is large, 2.23e+04. This might indicate that there are
   strong multicollinearity or other numerical problems.

* Conclusion
  Ultimately, we found that NAEP reading scores at the eigth grade
  level have increased since 1990. We then looked at the reading
  scores only in 2015, and attempted to find a factor that
  significantly affects the scores. Such factors were, median family
  income, divorse rate, and educational expediture. Of these factors,
  median family income was the only to significantly affect reading
  scores.

  Furthermore, it may be useful to note, that since expenditure did
  not have a significant effect on scores, we cannot conclude that
  increasing money spent on education per state will have an impact on
  score performance.

  Also, this study used divorse rate per state, however it may be beneficial
  to replace this factor with the number of single-family homes with
  children in school. This may provide a factor that is more directly
  related to students in school, since divorse rate includes all
  couples, even those without children in school.

  In the future, it would be appropriate to find more factors that
  affect reading scores across states. It is unrealistic to expect
  that a univariate analysis could accurately model a complex subject
  such as student reading performance across states.
